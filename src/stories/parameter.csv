"`tracking`  "|"A Primitive, Object, Array of primitive or array of objects to track change after.                                                   
If it object or arrays of objects the second argument must provide `key` name to identify the                                        
object for tracing.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                     
If the tracking value is primitive or array of primitives that `key` property can be skipped because the value of each primitive     
will use as an identify key.                                                                                                         "|"* primitive: `true/false` `0/1/2/3`  `""foo""/ ""bar""`/ 
* objects : `[{name:'foo',id:1},{name:'bar',id:2}]`  "
